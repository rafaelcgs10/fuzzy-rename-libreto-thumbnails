# Fuzzy Rename Libreto Thumbnails
This a small collection of Python scripts to rename your games based on files names for the box arts in the Libreto repository.


All you have to do is run

```
python rename
```

on the games folder.

This script works recusivally in the directory.
So if you have a `roms` folder centralizing all your roms and it has subdirectories, you should have no problem.

Don't worry, the script will prompt a question before start renaming files.
